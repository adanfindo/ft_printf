# ft_printf

This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

You have to implement the following conversions:
• %c Prints a single character.
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
• %% Prints a percent sign.
